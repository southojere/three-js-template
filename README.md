# ThreeJS Project Template

Reference: https://discoverthreejs.com/book

Framework agnostic ThreeJS template, decoupling your ThreeJS code from React, Svelte, Angular, or just vanilla JS code.

The basic idea behind this architecture is to allow us to easily plug our 3D "World" into any web app. All ThreeJS logic is contained in `src/World` read the `src/World/README.md` for more details about how this is structured.

Features:

- responsiveness
- animation loop (should be removed if not needed)
- Orbital controls

TODO/IMPROVEMENTS:

- [ ] create CLI to quickly scaffold three-js template?
